This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Quote form email configuration

The **Get a Quote** form submits to `POST /api/quote-request` and sends an email using Resend.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Set:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - `QUOTE_FROM_EMAIL` (must be a verified sender in Resend).
3. Keep recipient fixed at `usamaqureshi7.773@gmail.com` (already hardcoded server-side).

Important implementation detail:
- The sender (`from`) is `QUOTE_FROM_EMAIL`.
- The customer email from the form is used as `reply_to`.
- Optional uploaded file is attached when present.
